=====================
Getting Started
=====================
1) Set up server information (Machines on which your workers will run)

-  Give your machine a name using #Machine_Name
-  Specify the server, working directory, redis server, redis password, and the location of your saga environment
-  Make sure to have a new line after each specification, including the last one.

Example server_information.txt
--------------------------------------------------
#Futuregrid_India
service: pbs+ssh://vshah505@india.futuregrid.org
working_directory: /N/u/vshah505/worker/
redis_server: gw68.quarry.iu.teragrid.org
redis_pass: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
bliss_env: $HOME/sagaenv

#Futuregrid_Sierra
service: pbs+ssh://vshah505@sierra.futuregrid.org
working_directory: /N/u/vshah505/worker/
redis_server: gw68.quarry.iu.teragrid.org
redis_pass: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
bliss_env: $HOME/sagaenv

--------------------------------------------------

2) Set up dependencies (Files required for execution of your program)

-  Create a dependency list fo each machine listed in server_information.txt. Make sure to have the same names.
-  List the files for each machine that are needed for execution. Make sure to include worker.py and worker.sh
-  Make sure to have a new line after each list, including the last one.

Example dependencies.txt
----------------------
#Futuregrid_India
worker.py
worker.sh

#Futuregrid_Sierra
worker.py
worker.sh

----------------------

3) List of tasks
- Currently the list of tasks is coded within master.py and is found under: 
#write task list to redis server

- The following command is to write a sleep task for one second.
-----------------------------------------
redis_server.rpush(redis_list, "sleep 1")
-----------------------------------------
Enter the bash command that will be used to run your program in "" as the second paramter.

======================
Running Master/Worker
======================
Run the following command once all parameters have been set up:
master.py number_of_tasks number_of_workers number_of_machines

number_of_tasks		-> Number of tasks to write to redis server
number_of_workers	-> Number of workers to be created
number_of_machines	-> Number of machines to use (Will be used in the order listed in server_information.txt)
